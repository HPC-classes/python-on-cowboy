This needs a lot of work!

The goal is to bring the software carpentry shell and python lessons back to Cowboy.  

Feel free to create other python and submit scripts (in folders?) to demonstrate various ways someone might do this.

The possibilities are endless.

Imagine we have a zillion csv files, for example.

Do we want graphs, lots of them?  formated how?  for what?

Do we want data files with meaningful numbers?


What's in here: 

Dana -- clean these up:
inflammation.py -- doesn't work   
inflammation-images.py -- makes lots of png files in the output directory 
branch-inflammation-images.py  -- makes single pdf "multiple-inflammation.pdf" 
alldata.py  -- makes pdf "alldata.pdf" that graphs ALL patient data from ALL the csv files 
allmeans.py  -- works on jupyter, not cli 


Phillip:
all_patient_inflammation_serial.py -- text mean, max, min for each file and then all of them. 
    -- idea:  create 3 files: mean.csv, max.csv, min.csv with a row for each inflammation file and then an overal roww.



Keep:
data directory.
