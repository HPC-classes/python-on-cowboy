This needs a lot of work!

The goal is to bring the software carpentry shell and python lessons back to Cowboy.  

Feel free to create other python and submit scripts (in folders?) to demonstrate various ways someone might do this.

The possibilities are endless.

Imagine we have a zillion csv files, for example.

Do we want graphs, lots of them?  formated how?  for what?

Do we want data files with meaningful numbers?
